:: Read.me {"position":"300,25","size":"100,100"}
Story prompts begining with "::" were generated from the below listed prompt and discussion link with open.ai. I edited some of what it produced to shift some of the outcomes/ background code to follow more along the arc I was looking for and to mesh with the code/story I had written already.

https://chatgpt.com/share/6818e00f-5950-8007-b12f-e5a73b97cf22

I used open source images for all images provided thus far.


I used state setting code along with if-else statements to provide various outcomes specific to the class chosen at the start of the game. I initially ran into some issues with code flow and story flow when setting up the barter system when dealing with the troll. I ended up creating an inventory system using state setting code attached to the players choice of character to provide a list of item options when the player selected the "Attempt to Barter" option. This takes them from the "Look in Bag" prompt to outcomes depending on if-else statements providing different outcomes. I used state setting code to remove the item given to the troll from the player's inventory.

    The group seems unimpressed by your magical robes and harsh tone.
    "We already have a mage," one mutters. "But fine, if you can pull your weight."

(else-if: $class is "Warrior")[
    Your intimidating stature gets a grudging nod. "Arrogant, but strong," they say. "We could use that."

    They glance at your bow and sneer. "Fast fingers, slow brain?" one laughs. Still, they let you join.

Story prompts begining with "::" were generated from the below listed prompt and discussion link with open.ai.
 I edited some of what it produced to shift some of the outcomes/ background code to follow more along the arc I was looking for and to mesh with the code/story I had
  written already.

I used open source images for all images provided thus far.


I used state setting code along with if-else statements to provide various outcomes specific to the class chosen at the start of the game.
 I initially ran into some issues with code flow and story flow when setting up the barter system when dealing with the troll.
  I ended up creating an inventory system using state setting code attached to the players choice of character to provide a list of item options
   when the player selected the "Attempt to Barter" option. This takes them from the "Look in Bag" prompt to outcomes depending on if-else statements
    providing different outcomes. I used state setting code to remove the item given to the troll from the player's inventory.

I initially prompted ChatGPT using the example starting prompt modified with my basic idea for a game.
I asked it to write a game where a user was fighting a car sized bug.
I noticed initially that the LLM used more complicated coding than I was requesting so I prompted it to re-write using mostly if statements but it still ended up using quite a few case/witch functions.
I learned that ChatGPT used all of my tokens within the first four change prompts and wanted me to sign in.
I instead switched to Copilot and requested it to "help me modify this code to include an option to choose the weapon the player wishes to select from a short list of options:"
The way it handled that change prompt was interesting as it chose to circle back to switch/case functions for the choosing of the weapon.
When I prompted "Let's make this number generator function capable of generating more truly randomized numbers:" it gave me some intersting new examples of random number generation I hadn't heard of yet.
Ex. std::random_device
Ex. std::mt19937

I wasn't sure what the definitions were of those two examples so I asked Copilot if they were similar to the C version of srand() and rand()
The two examples are essentially more complicated versions of srand() and rand() that were created for C++ rather than C.
